  * Added function to stop/start the ocean animation
  * Added support for adjustable reflection damping in FFT simulation
  * Improved effeciency of the FFT surface generation
  * Made OceanCylinder a part of osgOcean itself so it's always present with the ocean
  * Ocean height can now to be changed

  * Added a new case to the example to illustrate collision detection
  * Added flag to disable all shaders and use only fixed pipeline
  * Underwater Scattering can now be enabled/disabled
  * Reflection/Refraction passes can now automatically enabled/disabled based on height
